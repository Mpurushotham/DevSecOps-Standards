# DevSecOps Standards

# ADO-test-scripts-example

**ACT AS:** You are a Senior Cloud Security Architect and DevOps Evangelist with 15+ years of experience across Azure, AWS, and GCP. You are an expert in DevSecOps methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native security controls. Your task is to create a definitive guide for implementing DevSecOps.

**AUDIENCE:** The document is intended for Cloud Engineers, DevOps Teams, Security Professionals, and Solution Architects who are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining secure cloud infrastructure and applications.

**OBJECTIVE:** Generate a comprehensive, multi-part guide titled "The Ultimate DevSecOps Framework: A Cross-Cloud Implementation Guide for Azure, AWS, and GCP." The guide must provide a practical, actionable roadmap for integrating security at every phase of the development lifecycle, tailored to the specific services and paradigms of each major cloud platform.

**STRUCTURE & CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**

Please structure the output as a formal technical document with the following sections. For each major cloud platform (Azure, AWS, GCP), you MUST provide a dedicated, parallel analysis.

**1. Introduction & Executive Summary**
    *   Define DevSecOps and its core principles (Shift Left, Continuous Security, Automation, Collaboration).
    *   Explain the business and technical benefits (faster delivery, reduced risk, compliance).
    *   Outline the shared responsibility model in the cloud and how DevSecOps fits within it.

**2. The DevSecOps Lifecycle: A Phase-by-Phase Breakdown**
    *   For each phase below, create a sub-section that explains the goal and then provides a **tailored table for Azure, AWS, and GCP**.
    *   **Phase 1: Plan & Design (Threat Modeling & Policy as Code)**
        *   *Goal:* Identify security requirements and threats before code is written.
        *   *Table Columns:* Concept (e.g., Infrastructure as Code Scanning), Azure Service/Tool (e.g., Azure Policy), AWS Service/Tool (e.g., AWS IAM Access Analyzer, cfn-nag), GCP Service/Tool (e.g., GCP Policy Intelligence, Forseti), Usage Instructions/Integration Steps.
    *   **Phase 2: Develop (SAST, SCA, Pre-commit Hooks)**
        *   *Goal:* Find and fix vulnerabilities in the code during development.
        *   *Table Columns:* Concept, Azure Service/Tool (e.g., GitHub Advanced Security, SonarQube on Azure), AWS Service/Tool (e.g., AWS CodeGuru, Amazon CodeWhisperer security scanning), GCP Service/Tool (e.g., GCP Security Commandline API with CI/CD), Usage Instructions.
    *   **Phase 3: Build & Test (CI/CD Security, DAST, Container Scanning)**
        *   *Goal:* Automate security checks within the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   *Table Columns:* Concept, Azure Service/Tool (e.g., Azure Pipelines with container scanning tasks), AWS Service/Tool (e.g., AWS CodeBuild with Inspector), GCP Service/Tool (e.g., Cloud Build with on-build security scans), Usage Instructions.
    *   **Phase 4: Deploy (Infrastructure Security, Secrets Management)**
        *   *Goal:* Securely deploy infrastructure and applications with managed secrets.
        *   *Table Columns:* Concept, Azure Service/Tool (e.g., Azure Key Vault, Bicep), AWS Service/Tool (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, AWS CloudFormation), GCP Service/Tool (e.g., Google Secret Manager, Deployment Manager), Usage Instructions.
    *   **Phase 5: Operate & Monitor (CSPM, CWPP, SIEM, Incident Response)**
        *   *Goal:* Continuously monitor and protect running workloads.
        *   *Table Columns:* Concept, Azure Service/Tool (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Monitor), AWS Service/Tool (e.g., AWS Security Hub, Amazon GuardDuty), GCP Service/Tool (e.g., Google Security Command Center, Chronicle SIEM), Usage Instructions.

**3. Cross-Cloud Use Case Studies**
    *   Provide detailed, step-by-step walkthroughs for implementing DevSecOps for specific scenarios. For each use case, explain the implementation for all three clouds side-by-side.
    *   **Use Case A: Securing a Serverless Application (API)**
    *   **Use Case B: Securing a Containerized Application (Kubernetes)**
    *   **Use Case C: Securing a Virtual Machine-Based Workload.**

**4. Example Software Tools & Integration Catalog**
    *   Beyond native services, include a dedicated section for popular third-party tools.
    *   Organize by function: SAST (e.g., Snyk, Checkmarx), SCA (e.g., Mend, Snyk Open Source), CSPM (e.g., Wiz, Lacework). For each tool, briefly explain its value and provide a generic example of how it would integrate into a pipeline (e.g., a sample command or pipeline snippet).

**5. Conclusion & Best Practices Summary**
    *   Summarize key takeaways.
    *   Provide a checklist for getting started with DevSecOps in a multi-cloud environment.
    *   Discuss common pitfalls to avoid.

**TONE & FORMAT:**
*   **Tone:** Professional, authoritative, clear, and instructional. Avoid excessive marketing jargon.
*   **Format:** Use clear headings, sub-headings, bullet points, and tables for easy readability. Assume the content will be exported to a PDF or Markdown file.
